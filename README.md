# ENGO551_Lab6

For this lab, we learned about the Turf.js library to add line simplification to our web mapping applications.

Requirement 1

The first requirement was to allow a user to draw a polyline on the map, which was done using the leaflet library.

Requirement 2

The second requirement was to allow a user to "simplify" a created polyline, and to remove any polylines that were drawn by the user.
Using the Simplify function in the Turf.js library, the drawn polyline keeps the starting and ending vertices while deleting the rest.
There is also a button to remove all polylines.
